# Dr. Shivanka Rajapakshe — Personal Medical Website

A modern, responsive personal website for **Dr. Shivanka Rajapakshe**, a medical doctor based in Kandy, Sri Lanka.

Built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons. Designed as a premium, trustworthy medical portfolio — not a hospital admin system.

**Live site (after deployment):** [https://kasun-dave.github.io/shivanka/](https://kasun-dave.github.io/shivanka/)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/shivanka/](http://localhost:5173/shivanka/) in your browser.

> **Note:** The dev server uses the `/shivanka/` base path (configured for GitHub Pages). Always include `/shivanka/` in the URL during local development.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Editing Doctor Information

All professional content lives in **`src/data/doctor.ts`**. Open this file and replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]` value before publishing.

### Fields to update

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `specialty` | Medical specialty (e.g. General Practitioner) |
| `biography` | Professional biography |
| `philosophy` | Medical philosophy |
| `registrationNumber` | SLMC registration number |
| `university` | Medical university |
| `hospital` | Primary hospital |
| `clinic` | Clinic name |
| `phone` | Contact phone number |
| `whatsapp` | WhatsApp number (digits only, e.g. `94771234567`) |
| `email` | Professional email |
| `consultationHours` | Opening hours |
| `clinicAddress` | Full clinic address |
| `googleMapsUrl` | Google Maps link |
| `canonicalUrl` | Live website URL |
| `social` | Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter URLs |

Also update arrays for `services`, `qualifications`, `certifications`, `experience`, `affiliations`, and `galleryItems`.

---

## Replacing Images

Drop new images into `public/images/` — **no component code changes needed**.

| File | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `public/images/profile/doctor-main.jpg` | Hero section portrait |
| `public/images/profile/doctor-about.jpg` | About section photo |
| `public/images/gallery/gallery-1.jpg` | Gallery image 1 |
| `public/images/gallery/gallery-2.jpg` | Gallery image 2 |
| `public/images/gallery/gallery-3.jpg` | Gallery image 3 |
| `public/images/certificates/` | Certificate images (optional) |

**Tips:**
- Use JPG or PNG format
- Recommended hero size: 800×1000px or larger
- Gallery images: 1200×900px or similar 4:3 ratio
- If an image is missing, a graceful placeholder is shown automatically

To add more gallery items, add entries to the `galleryItems` array in `src/data/doctor.ts` and place the image file in `public/images/gallery/`.

---

## Configuring WhatsApp

1. Open `src/data/doctor.ts`
2. Set `doctor.whatsapp` to your number in international format **without** `+` or spaces:

```typescript
whatsapp: '94771234567',  // Sri Lanka example
```

3. The appointment form will open WhatsApp with a pre-filled message on submit
4. The floating WhatsApp button appears automatically when a number is configured

**Demo mode:** If `whatsapp` is empty, the form still validates and shows a preview message instead of failing.

---

## Disabling Testimonials

The testimonials section uses **sample placeholder content** — not verified patient reviews.

To hide the entire section:

```typescript
// src/data/doctor.ts
export const siteConfig: SiteConfig = {
  showTestimonials: false,  // ← set to false
  // ...
};
```

To use real testimonials, replace the `testimonials` array entries and set `isSample: false`.
